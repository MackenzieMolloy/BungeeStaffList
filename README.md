*BungeeStaffList is a plugin for [Bungeecord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/), that shows where all online Staff Members, Players with permision __stafflist.list__, are on the Network.*

It hooks into [PremiumVanish](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/14404/) and [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) allowing for vanished staff to be hidden from the list, and their ranks to be displayed, and be ordered in the list.
